# Interface between MATLAB programming language and HEC-RAS water modelling software

This is a repository of the code presented in the article **Design of a MATLAB HEC-RAS Interface to Test Advanced Control Strategies on Water Systems** https://doi.org/10.3390/w13060763

## Notes

### Limitations

Due to GitHub limitations, zipped "essential" package could not be uploaded to GitHub. 

Instead, code is available and docs will be converted to GitHub Docs in a future release.

### Non GitHub friendly code

This repository is a simple upload of code as is and is not mean for collaboration. It is a snapshot of code before adaptation to GitHub standards.

If you want to work on the code itself, please refer to the matlab-hecras-interface-dev repo available there : [link to add]
